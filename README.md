Autoresolver Program for Ideathon

Auto-Resolution: Based on the output provided by the model once it has been validated and tested, Predefined actions will be established for most common issues, enabling the program to automatically resolve them without human intervention. 
To streamline this we can use automation scripts to perform various tasks.

HITL integration: If the auto resolution cannot resolve the issue, we can bring the Human in the Loop. Here, the human can provide relevant expertise to resolve complex or unique issues. Depending on the training level and learning capability of our model, it can learn on the basis of this review. The HITL integration will involve creating an interactive user interface for designated human operators. This interface will enable seamless communication with the AI system, allowing operators to view identified issues, access relevant information, and provide their expertise in resolving complex cases.
